# Karabas-128

**Yet another ZX Spectrum clone ;)**

## Intro

ZX Spectrum 128k replica with real **Z80** CPU and almost all logic in CPLD Altera **EPM7128STC100**. PCB designed to fit into original ZX Spectrum 48k (rubber keys) case.

## The idea

The idea was to make a **cheap** ZX Spectrum 128k clone with minimum components. Some parts of this schematics are grabbed from the **Superfo's Harlequin 48k** rev.G project (like AC/DC unit, tape in comparator, PAL coder). The heart of this project is real Z80 CPU and ULA implementation on Altera CPLD EPM7128STC100. CPLD design based on successor project **Speccy2007** by **syd** and it's modified version with single RAM IC by **.jackson**.

## More info

This is the first fabricated prototype PCB, it just works, it's fully tested, except small minor issues (please see ERRATA).
